Manufacturing Dashboard Overview

Our Manufacturing Dashboard is a powerful tool designed to provide real-time insights into production processes, enhance operational efficiency, and drive informed decision-making. With user-friendly visuals and interactive elements, the dashboard serves as a central hub for monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs), resource utilization, and overall production health.

In Employee wise Rejected Qty I try to find out how many quantities are rejected by the employees who are working in the manufacture company, through we find which employee do irresponsible work by doing this it helps in reduce rejected quantity.

Also in Department wise Rejected Qty we fetch which department gives more rejected quantity as it seems WOVEN LABELS gives 521508 rejected quantity.

And in MACHINE wise REJECTED Qty we seems C007 machine gives so many rejected quantity it means machine has some mechanical or technical issue so by fixing this we reduce many quantities and it helps in company profit.

This dashboard created using SQL and POWER BI. Firstly took data from csv file to sql server using Command prompt then from SQL to Power Bi.
In this used some KPI's and Slicer to make filter data according to Buyer, Delivery Period & Work centre name.
(Sum of Rejected Qty) chart show which buyer rejected many quantities through which it is possible to identify root cause of rejected quantities and try to reduce rejection.

(Sum of Manufactured Qty by Operation name) show Operational Breakdown:

We categorize manufacturing activities by operation names (e.g., cut&fold, printing, weaving) to understand the contribution of each process to the total production volume.
Quantity Tracking:By tracking the quantity produced under each operation, we can assess productivity levels and identify which operations yield the highest output.
Profit Contribution:Each operation’s manufacturing quantity is analyzed alongside its associated costs and revenue, allowing us to determine the profit contribution of each operation to the company’s bottom line.
